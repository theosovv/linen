# batch()

Batches multiple signal updates together to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

## Signature

```typescript
function batch(fn: () => void): void
```

## Parameters

- `fn: () => void` - A function that contains multiple signal updates.

## Returns

Void.

## Example

```typescript
import { signal, computed, effect, batch } from 'linen';

const firstName = signal('John');
const lastName = signal('Doe');
const fullName = computed(() => `${firstName.value} ${lastName.value}`);

effect(() => {
  console.log(`Full name: ${fullName.value}`);
});
// Logs: "Full name: John Doe"

// Without batching, this would cause the effect to run twice
firstName.value = 'Jane'; // Effect runs: "Full name: Jane Doe"
lastName.value = 'Smith'; // Effect runs: "Full name: Jane Smith"

// With batching, the effect runs only once after all updates
batch(() => {
  firstName.value = 'Bob';
  lastName.value = 'Johnson';
});
// Effect runs once: "Full name: Bob Johnson"
```

## Usage Notes

- Use `batch()` when you need to update multiple signals at once and want to prevent intermediate recalculations.
- Batching is especially useful for performance optimization in complex applications with many interdependent signals.

## Implementation Details

Note: The `batch()` function is currently a placeholder in the implementation and will be fully implemented in the future. Currently, it simply executes the provided function without any batching behavior.
